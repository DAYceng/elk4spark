# es_data

By default, the elasticsearch data will be stored here. Be cautious -- deleting or modifying this folder will also affect the elasticsearch instance in the docker container. On the plus side, this shared folder will allow you to safely shutdown, restart, or update the elasticsearch container without worrying about losing the data you've collected so far.
